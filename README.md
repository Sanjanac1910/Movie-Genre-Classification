Objective 🎯

This project's goal is to categorize the IMDB movie dataset according to genres and study the relationship between them.

Problem Statement ❓

Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual
information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, or Support Vector
Machines.
